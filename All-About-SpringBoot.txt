The Spring team had launched Spring Boot in 2013

I sincerely hope that readers appreciate and benefit from the contents of this book
and find it useful in their Spring Boot application development. Any remarks or suggestions for improving the content of the book are most welcome and eagerly awaited.

You can get executable snippets of code from the liveBook (online) version of this
book at https://livebook.manning.com/book/spring-boot-in-practice. The complete
code for the examples in the book is available for download from the Manning website at www.manning.com/books/spring-boot-in-practice, and from GitHub at https://
github.com/spring-boot-in-practice/repo.

For instance, if you would like to run the current Spring Boot application, you can execute the following command in command-line or terminal from the same directory where pom.xml is located: 

**************** mvn spring-boot:run ********************
**************** mvn dependency:tree ********************
**************** mvn package         ********************
	java -jar config-data-file-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.config.name=sbip
Listing 2.7 Executing a Spring Boot application with spring.config.location property
	java -jar target\config-data-file-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar --spring.config.location=C:\sbip\repo\ch02\config-data-file\data\sbip.yml


By default, Spring Boot reads the application.properties or application.yml file from the following locations:

1. The classpath root
2. The classpath /config package
3. The current directory
4. The /config subdirectory in the current directory
5. Immediate child directories of the /config subdirectory

The higher sequence number overrides the properties of the lower sequence number:

1. SpringApplication
2. @PropertySource
3. Config data file
4. OS environment variable
5. Command line arguments
